This repo is a work in progress about using color dimensions on categorical map to display data dimensions.

How can colors be used to unravel spatiotemporal patterns in a multivariate geographical space? Perceptually consistent color spaces such as L\*a\*b\* or L\*c\*h\* are well defined, but their use in qualitative cartography is still relatively rare. Furthermore, qualitative color palettes are often randomly selected and do not relate the distance between colors to degrees of difference between categories depicted on the map. This study presents a tool allowing to select colors and automatically connect them to a multivariate space. It is applied to a geodemographic map of the San Francisco Bay Area where colors for 15 clusters can be algorithmically selected to reflect similarities  between clusters in the attribute space or to maximize contrast between spatially contiguous clusters. This study shows that careful consideration of a color palette and its relation to the mapped data space can assist in the visualization of complex spatiotemporal patterns.
